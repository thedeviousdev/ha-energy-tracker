# Energy Window Tracker

A Home Assistant custom integration that tracks energy consumed **during** specific time windows. Each window gets its own sensor showing energy used in that window.

## How It Works

| Time period    | Sensor behaviour                                |
| ---            | ---                                             |
| Before window  | Value is 0 kWh                                  |
| During window  | Tracks energy consumed so far (live)             |
| After window   | Shows final energy used during that window       |

Snapshots are taken at the **start** and **end** of each window and persisted to HA storage, so sensors survive restarts.

## Installation

### HACS (recommended)
1. Open HACS → Integrations → ⋮ → Custom repositories
2. Add this repo URL, category **Integration**
3. Install **Energy Window Tracker**
4. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual
1. Copy the `custom_components/energy_offpeak/` folder into your HA `config/custom_components/` directory
2. Restart Home Assistant

## Configuration

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → + Add Integration**
2. Search for **Energy Window Tracker**
3. **Step 1** — Select your **energy sensor** (the daily cumulative kWh sensor, e.g. `sensor.today_energy_import`). Click **Submit**.
4. **Step 2** — Set **source name** (defaults to the sensor’s name) and add windows:
   - Each row has: **Window name**, **Start time**, **End time**
   - Fill in as many rows as you need (up to 8). Leave a row with start = end to skip it.
   - Click **Submit** when done.

Each window becomes a separate sensor (e.g. `My Sensor - Morning Peak`). Windows may overlap.

## Updating after setup

To change the source name or any window’s name or time range:

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services**
2. Find **Energy Window Tracker** and click it (the integration card, not an individual sensor)
3. Click **CONFIGURE**
4. Edit **Source name** and the window rows (name, start, end). Leave a row with start = end to remove that window. Click **Submit** when done.

## Dashboard card (Lovelace)

A Lovelace card is included so you can show your window sensors on a dashboard. Add the card's resource once, then add the card and pick your entities.

1. **Add the resource** — In your dashboard: **Dashboard → ⋮ → Resources → + Add resource → URL** and add:
   ```
   /energy-window-tracker/energy-window-card.js
   ```
   Type: **JavaScript Module**. (If you use YAML for Lovelace, add the same URL under `resources` in your dashboard YAML with `type: module`.)
2. **Add the card** — Edit a dashboard, add card, choose **Energy Window Tracker**, then add the sensor entities you want to display.

The card shows each entity's name, current value, and unit. No build step is required.

## Sensor Attributes

| Attribute        | Description                                                       |
| ---              | ---                                                                |
| source_entity    | The tracked source sensor                                          |
| start / end      | Window times for this sensor                                       |
| status           | Current mode: before_window, during_window, after_window, etc.     |

## Notes

- The source sensor **must** be a daily cumulative total that resets at midnight (e.g. from a Shelly, Fronius, SolarEdge, or similar device)
- If HA restarts during a window, the start snapshot is restored from storage and the end snapshot will be captured at the window end time
- You can configure multiple instances for different sensors or window sets
